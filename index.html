                    I'm Divyansh Sharma, a passionate Full Stack Web Developer
                    from Ajmer, currently living in Jaipur for my studies. As a
                    3rd-year Computer Science student, I've developed and
                    deployed several impactful projects using the MERN stack and
                    modern UI technologies like Tailwind and Bootstrap. I thrive
                    in collaborative environments, love building intuitive user
                    interfaces and robust backends, and enjoy exploring design
                    and development from end to end. I’m a sports enthusiast who
                    enjoys basketball, volleyball, and cricket, and bring the
                    same energy and discipline from the field into my coding
                    life. Being a nature lover and someone who admires leaders
                    like Bear Grylls and Kalam, I constantly strive to push
                    limits — both personal and technical — to become a top-tier
                    developer.

                  <h1>Educational Details</h1>
                  <p>
                    I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer
                    Science at the Rajasthan Institute of Engineering and
                    Technology (3rd year). My earlier academic years at H.K.H
                    Public School and Demonstration Multipurpose School helped
                    me develop discipline, leadership, and communication skills
                    through debates, writing, and anchoring events. In college,
                    I've shifted my focus toward web technologies, learning
                    everything from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js,
                    Express, and MongoDB to foundational CS subjects like Java
                    and DSA. My academic path reflects my dedication to becoming
                    a high-caliber developer capable of building scalable,
                    real-world solutions.

                  <h1>Achievements</h1>
                  <p>
                    I've built and deployed multiple full-stack projects like a
                    Zerodha Clone, Wanderlust listing app, and several
                    utility-based web tools that showcase both frontend and
                    backend skills. I have also completed certifications in Full
                    Stack Web Development and Data Structures & Algorithms in
                    Java, which strengthened my foundation in modern development
                    practices and efficient problem-solving. I’ve actively
                    participated in college-level hackathons where I worked on
                    real-world challenges under time pressure and collaborated
                    with teams to build functional prototypes. Alongside this,
                    I’ve competed in inter-school and inter-college sports
                    tournaments (cricket, basketball, volleyball) and earned the
                    “Mr. All-rounder” title in school for excelling in
                    academics, leadership, and athletics. My development journey
                    is deeply rooted in self-learning, curiosity, and a drive to
                    constantly upskill. Participating in seminars, handling
                    group projects, and independently hosting production apps
                    reflect both my technical confidence and my goal of becoming
                    a high-performing engineer ready for global opportunities.
